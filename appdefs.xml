        <title level="2">License</title>
        <content>
{{ defs.app.friendly_name }} supports a cross-platform custom license model,
which means that a license can be purchased and then be used on all the buyer's
machines.

While {{ defs.app.friendly_name }} can be used/evaluated without a license,
certain features, like renaming files, won't work without one.

A license can be purchased at https://www.filebot.net/purchase.html.

        <title level="3">Installing a License</title>
        <content>
Once purchased, the license file received via email can be saved on the host,
into the configuration directory of the container (i.e. in the directory mapped
to `/config`).

Then, start or restart the container to have it automatically installed.

**NOTE**: The license file is expected to have a `.psm` extension.

      <section>
        <title level="3">Donation Supported Version</title>
        <content>
In the past, {{ defs.app.friendly_name }} was donation supported, meaning that
the author was expecting users to donate an arbitrary amount of money if they
like and use the software.

The last version of {{ defs.app.friendly_name }} supporting this model is
`4.7.9`.  This version is implemented in container image version `1.0.2`.

To revert to this version, create the container by using
`jlesage/filebot:v1.0.2` as the image name.

**NOTE**: While no license is required to use this version, it is no longer
supported and maintained by the author of {{ defs.app.friendly_name }}.
